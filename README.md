**This tool doesn't work right now, as it depends on 3rd party APIs that aren't working the way they were.**

A command line tool for reconnaissance using virtual payment address (VPA).
This tool leverages the openness available with the UPI platform to find :
1. UPI ID and name associated with a mobile number
2. UPI ID and name associated with a gmail account
3. UPI ID and name associated with a vehicle registration number. Leveraging UPI id associated with a fastag.

## Disclaimer

Note: Unified Payment Interface ("UPI") Virtual Payment Addresses ("VPAs") do not carry a data security classification by virtue of their usage in practice, and should as such be considered to be public information, similar to how email addresses may be considered to be public information.

This tool allows users to 1) check the existence of UPI payment addresses, and 2) fetch associated information about the account holder, in an automated manner based on provided input. This functionality is already available (however, not in an automated fashion) through most UPI payment applications available on the Android and/or iOS platforms.

This tool is provided "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
